# âœ¨ Fun Fact: 

One of my favorite lessons from computer class is something called the Rubber Duck Method. The idea is to keep a rubber duck by your computer and, whenever you hit a roadblock in your code, explain your problem out loud to the duck. It sounds silly, but somehow, talking it through helps you see the issue more clearly. Itâ€™s weirdly effective... and now Iâ€™ll never code without my duck nearby!
