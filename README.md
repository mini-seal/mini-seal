# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Alisen! 

ðŸŽ“ Sophomore at St. Johnâ€™s University, studying Computer Science 

ðŸ”­ I'm an aspiring computer scientist with a growing passion for artificial intelligence, machine learning, game design, and cybersecurity. 

My journey into computer science began in middle school, when I first discovered how fun and rewarding coding could be through Code.org. Since then, that curiosity has turned into a passion for building, problem-solving, and exploring the many ways technology can shape our world.

Recently, I've been exploring the fundamentals of programming and AI through the Break Through Tech program at Cornell University. I also participated in the Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program, developing technical and creative skills while collaborating on team-based projects.

Whether it's designing game environments, experimenting with AI models, or learning how to secure systems, I'm driven by the challenge of creating meaningful digital experiences. I'm excited to keep learning, growing, and collaborating as I work toward a future in tech.

# âœ¨ Fun Fact: 

One of my favorite lessons from computer class is something called the Rubber Duck Method. The idea is to keep a rubber duck by your computer and, whenever you hit a roadblock in your code, explain your problem out loud to the duck. It sounds silly, but somehow, talking it through helps you see the issue more clearly. Itâ€™s weirdly effective... and now Iâ€™ll never code without my duck nearby!
